# **Data-Analysis-WhatsApp-Chat**
**This repository attempts to identify the main trends in a WhatsApp chat using data analysis and manipulation techniques in Python.**

The goal of this project is to explore the WhatsApp chats I have had with my best friend since 2019 to identify trends in the way we communicate, such as the words we use the most, the days and times we talk the most, which emojis we use the most, etc. To do this, I used analysis and manipulation tools in Python, which are detailed and explained in the Jupyter notebook uploaded to this repository. The main results are summarized below, but for more details you can refer to the aforementioned Jupyter notebook.
Pd: My best friend has reviewed this notebook and doesn't mind me posting it.
