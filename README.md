# **Data-Analysis-WhatsApp-Chat**
**This repository seeks to identify the main trends in a WhatsApp chat through the manipulation and use of data analysis techniques in Pyhon.**

This project is about exploring the WhatsApp chats I have had with my best friend since 2019 to identify trends in the way we communicate, such as the words we use most, the days and times we talk most often, which emojis we use most, and so on.
To do this, I used analysis and manipulation tools in Python, which are detailed and explained in the Jupyter notebook uploaded to this repository. 
The main results are summarized below, but for more details you can consult the Jupyter notebook mentioned above.

Pd: My best friend has reviewed this work and has given me permission to publish it.
